    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">It is important for my client to understand that their website is what the users see, and therefor they have no understanding or idea of what is going on when they click buttons. Things happens behind the scenes, otherwise the website wouldn’t be useful.
        <li>We can ensure the data that a system accepts is in the right format. Here we can use third-party solutions, like NodeJS where we can sanitizing HTML code. For sanitizing SQL code, we can use ORM.</li>
        <li>Through authorization and authentication we need to ensure thy are secure and hard to crack. Here we can use an open-standard authorization protocol or framework.</li>
        <li>When we also use third-party application, we want to use application that are trusted and tested. Here we can check the amount of downloads the application have per week. The more, the better.</li>
        <li>We can also use the Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration, this is an auto process of delivering and integrating code to production. It runs every change against some security checks, 
              and will then decide the delivery of the change. If some changes doesn’t pass the control or checks, they will be rejected and marked for rework. This helps us catch oversights and maintain  the reliability of changes to a codebase.</li>
        <li>We also need to understand that a network is the connection of nodes, so we can share data across nodes. We need to protect the exchange of data across the network. Be aware of that network you connect to. Data could be compromised through the hosting platform.</li>
